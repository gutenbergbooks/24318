<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>


<p>Some idea of the amount of distress
there is among Stock Exchange men,
owing to the continued depression, may
be gathered from the fact that a number
of members, anxious to get to Brighton
on their recent holiday on the 1st inst.,
walked all the way.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>While there would seem to be no
"Picture of the Year," the canvas
which appears to attract anyhow most
feminine attention is the Hon. <span class="sc">John
Collier's</span> "Clytemnestra," with its
guess at the fashion of to-morrow&mdash;the
low-neck blouse carried a little bit
further.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A publication entitled <i>Pictures and
the Picturegoer</i> has made
its appearance, and, please,
we want to know what a
Picturegoer is. Suffragettes,
it is true, are apt to go <i>for</i>
pictures, but we have never
known anyone merely go
pictures.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Sculptors submitting
designs for a statue of
<span class="sc">Peter the Great</span>, to be
set up at the Winter Palace,
St. Petersburg, are required
by the conditions not only
to produce a statue which
will be recognized by the
man in the street as that of
the monarch, but it must
also convey the idea that
he spent his last days in
the Palace. Possibly this
might be effected by his
wearing his linen collar
inside out, plainly showing
the marking, "<span class="sc">Peter the Gt. Winter
Palace</span>."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>In the duel which took place last
week between M. <span class="sc">Caillaux</span> and M.
<span class="sc">d'Alli&egrave;res</span> the ex-Finance Minister
fired in the air. As a result, we hear,
aviation societies all over France are
protesting against what they consider
may develop into an exceedingly dangerous
practice.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>As regards the result of the duel, M.
<span class="sc">d'Alli&egrave;res</span> was certainly the more
successful of the two. He fired at the
ground and hit it. M. <span class="sc">Caillaux</span> aimed
at the sky and missed it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The House of Commons has passed
the second reading of a Bill to enable
Health Resorts and Watering Places
to spend a portion of their rates on
advertising. The urgent necessity for
such a measure would appear to be
proved by the fact that newspapers
of every shade of political opinion
approve it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"Democracy," says Lord <span class="sc">Haldane</span>,
"is rapidly finding its feet." But it
will not gain much if at the same time
it loses its head.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"A rector," we read, "has written
to his bishop and to his wife announcing
his elopement with the wife of one
of his parishioners." This is a little
act of courtesy which some men would
not have thought of.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The London County Council proposes
to allow on the Aldwych site
a circular experimental railway on the
Kearney high-speed mono-rail system.
It seems strange that what is undoubtedly
the most rugged and wildest
tract of forest land in London should
for so long have been without railway
facilities. To nature-lovers, however,
the proposal is as distasteful as the idea
of a railway up Borrowdale.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>We had thought that races between
omnibuses had, owing to an entire lack
of encouragement on the part of the
police, died out, but we see that the
L.C.O.C. is now advertising "<span class="sc">Another
Motor-Bus Derby</span>."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The police are said to be viewing
with some apprehension the spread of
habits of cleanliness among our house-breakers.
Last week, for instance, some
burglars who paid a visit to a Birmingham
firm, after opening a safe and
removing its contents, obtained a bucket
of water and carefully removed all
finger-marks.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>At a recent smoking-match at
Brighton the winner kept an eighth
of an ounce of tobacco alight for 103
minutes. The tobacco trade, we understand,
is strongly opposed to the
holding of competitions of this nature,
"which serve no useful purpose whatever."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"There are 'vintage years' for
babies," says Dr. <span class="sc">James Kerr</span>. These
must be the years when they take most
readily to the bottle.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Extract from an account in <i>The
Birmingham News</i> of a meeting at
Solihull:&mdash;"The next business was the
presentation of a handsome breakfast
egg to the Rev. Courtnay Smith, B.A."
Once upon a time such gifts were
confined to political gatherings.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>In the course of his exploring
expedition Mr.
<span class="sc">Roosevelt</span> lost nearly four
stone in weight, and it is
rumoured that Mr. <span class="sc">Taft</span>
may once again follow in
his footsteps.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A vulgar person with no
respect for wealth has
suggested that the Royal
Automobile Club shall
change its name to the Hotel
Nouveau Ritz.</p>

<p>Another Mysterious
Disappearance.</p>

<p>From a catalogue:&mdash;</p>

Authority to pay for charges,
the owner having been lost sight of, and
bottled by us last year."
</p></blockquote>

<p>We hope that, after this callous confession,
Scotland Yard will now take
action.</p>

<p>We understand that the famous Presidential
biography, <i>From Log-Cabin

another, entitled, <i>From White House to
Semi-attached <span class="sc">Villa</span></i>.</p>

<p>In this picture, however, the gentleman's
interior is wisely left to the

<h2>MR. ROOSEVELT'S DISCOVERIES.</h2>

<h3><span class="sc">Scrapping the Map in Brazil.</span></h3>

<p>We are glad to be able to supplement with some further
interesting details the meagre accounts of Mr. <span class="sc">Roosevelt's</span>
explorations in Brazil which have appeared in the daily
papers.</p>

<p>Not only did Mr. <span class="sc">Roosevelt</span> add to the map a new river
nearly a thousand miles long, but he has discovered a
gigantic mountain, hitherto undreamt of even by Dr. <span class="sc">Cook</span>,
to which he has attached the picturesque name of Mount
Skyscraper. The lower slopes were thickly infested with
cannibals, whom Mr. <span class="sc">Roosevelt</span> converted from anthropophagy
by a sermon lasting six hours and containing
300,000 words&mdash;almost exactly as many as are contained
in Mr. <span class="sc">de Morgan</span>'s new novel.</p>

<p>The middle regions are densely covered with an impenetrable
forest inhabited by rhomboidal armadillos and
gigantic crabs, to which Mr. <span class="sc">Roosevelt</span> has given the
name of Kermit crabs, to commemorate the escape of his
son, who was carried off by one of these monsters and
rescued by a troglodyte guide after a desperate struggle.
On emerging from the forest the travellers were faced by
perpendicular granite crags, which they ascended on the
backs of some friendly condors.... The summit proved
to be an extensive plateau, the site of a prehistoric city,
built of pedunculated wood-pulp. Lying among the ruins
was a gigantic mastodon in excellent preservation, which
Mr. <span class="sc">Roosevelt</span> brought down on his shoulders.</p>

<p>It was after the descent from Mount Skyscraper, which
was accomplished in parachutes, that Mr. <span class="sc">Roosevelt</span>
struck the new river, the upper parts of which were utterly
unknown except to some wild rubber-necked Indians. In consequence
of its character and size Mr. <span class="sc">Roosevelt</span> originally
thought of calling it the Taft, but finally decided on the
Rio Encyclop&aelig;dia in virtue of its volume.</p>

<p>The journey was made in canoes and was full of incident.
Descending the great Golliwog Falls Mr. <span class="sc">Roosevelt's</span>
canoe was smashed to atoms, but the <span class="sc">ex-President</span>
escaped with only slight injury to his eyeglasses, after a
desperate conflict with a pliocene crocodile. The Encyclop&aelig;dia
River, as described by Mr. <span class="sc">Roosevelt</span>, resembles
the Volga, the Hoang-ho and the Mississippi; but it is
richer in snags and of a deeper and more luscious purple
than any of them. Near its junction with the Mandragora
it runs uphill for several miles, with the result that the
canoes were constantly capsizing. The waters of Mandragora
are of a curiously soporific character, while those
of the River Madeira have a toxic quality which renders
them dangerous when drunk in large quantities.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Roosevelt</span>, it may be added, is shortly expected in
London, when he will lecture before the Royal Geographical
Society, Master <span class="sc">Anthony Asquith</span> having kindly consented
to preside.</p>

<h2>TO MY HUSBAND'S BANKER.</h2>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p><span class="sc">Florence</span>, <i>May 2nd</i>.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p><span class="sc">Dear Mr. S.</span>,&mdash;We have been here a week, and I feel I
really must write and thank you for what I can see is
going to be the most lovely holiday.</p>

<p>It was ripping of you to let us come&mdash;for <i>sending</i> us, in
fact. I can't think why more people don't do it&mdash;I mean
travel when they can't afford it. Perhaps it is that all
bankers aren't so good-natured as you are. I shall tell all
my friends to come to you in future. Of course I shall
only recommend the conscientious ones. <i>We</i> are being
frightfully conscientious. For instance, when we arrived we
purposely didn't go to a hotel some friends of ours were at
because it was two francs a day dearer than one we found
in <i>Baedeker</i>&mdash;though as I told Fred I don't believe you'd
have grudged us the two francs a bit. The only thing I have
on my conscience a little is that in Paris, where we stayed
three days on our way out, we <i>did</i> go to rather good restaurants.
But I had never been to Paris before, and I thought,
when you knew that, you would quite approve, because first
impressions are everything, aren't they? It is rather as if
you were an invisible host everywhere we go. "Of course
you will have a liqueur with your coffee, Mrs. Merrison?"
I hear you say after dinner; and really, Grand Marnier
(<i>cordon jaune</i>) <i>is</i> heavenly, isn't it?</p>

<p>Then we came on here, and, do you know, "The Birth of
Venus" nearly made me cry when I first saw it, it's so
beautiful. I shall never forget that it was you who
introduced me to it, so to speak.</p>

<p>And isn't Pisa jolly?</p>

<p>Oh, there's just one other thing I wanted to tell you.
Before we came away we gave a little farewell dinner to
one or two of our most intimate friends. It came out of
the travelling money; and I do feel you ought to have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page365" id="page365"></a>[pg 365]</span>
asked too, when you were really our host. But you see I
don't know you <i>very</i> well (except through your actions),
and I thought that just possibly you might have felt a
little out of it. But I want you very much to come and
dine with us one night when we are home again. I think
it is time we knew each other ever so much better.</p>

<p>Well, no more now as we are off to lunch. (How ridiculously
cheap food is in Italy, isn't it?) We shall be home
in three weeks, I expect. I wish we could stay longer,
especially as it's really cheaper to stay here than to come
home, now we <i>are</i> here. But we mustn't put too much
strain on your hospitality.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Yours always gratefully, <span class="sc">Isabel Merrison</span>.</p>

<h2>THE NOBLEST WORK OF MAN.</h2>

<p>[In an article on Animal Training it has been stated that "wolves
are so stupid it is a waste of time trying to do anything with them,"
and that "it is a wonderful tribute to the trainer's skill that he has
succeeded in evolving so faithful a companion as the dog from this
unpromising material."]</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Full many a time when I've been overwrought,</p>
<p class="i2">And all has seemed beset by doubts and fogs,</p>
<p>I have gleaned ample comfort from the thought,</p>
<p class="i2">"Nature is kindly; she has given us dogs</p>
<p>To share our griefs with sympathetic eyes</p>
<p>And force us out for healthy exercise."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>But, Carlo, I was wrong to take that view;</p>
<p class="i2">Nature, though wonderful, does not (I find)</p>
<p>Deserve the credit of evolving you;</p>
<p class="i2">A trainer did it, just by being kind;</p>
<p>Your rise from wolfish ancestors you owe</p>
<p>To some prim&aelig;val impresario.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>One sees the scene: how in the bygone days</p>
<p class="i2">Our forbears, fresh from bludgeoning their foes,</p>
<p>Would gather round to watch with glad amaze</p>
<p class="i2">A wolf who balanced rocks upon his nose.</p>
<p>"How quaint! How human!" thus their praises flowed;</p>
<p>"Look at his ikey way of wearing woad!"</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And ever as the long years took their course</p>
<p class="i2">The trainer's skill came farther to the front,</p>
<p>Until, through gentleness and moral force,</p>
<p class="i2">One wolf achieved the "trust-and-paid-for" stunt.</p>
<p>Topical, this produced unbounded fun,</p>
<p>Coming when commerce had but just begun.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Then cleverer grew the wolflings year by year,</p>
<p class="i2">And greater yearly grew the "spot-cash" boon</p>
<p>Given to trainers summoned to appear</p>
<p class="i2">And charm a cave-man's idle afternoon,</p>
<p>Till came the whisper, "This is not the least</p>
<p>Bit like a wolf's cub; 'tis a nobler beast."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And thus the dog was born; the gathered crowd</p>
<p class="i2">Cheered their approval of this wise remark;</p>
<p>A glad tail wagged its pride, and clear and loud</p>
<p class="i2">Rang out the music of the earliest bark,</p>
<p>While envious Nature sighed, "O parlous miss!</p>
<p>I <i>was</i> a silly not to think of this."</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Another!</span>" said George, flinging
down the card. "I have had just about
<span class="sc">ENOUGH OF IT</span>!" He spoke vehemently,
with an intonation that I have tried to
convey by the employment of capitals.
It was obvious that he was deeply
moved.</p>

<p>"Do you mind explaining?" I asked.</p>

<p>"It explains itself," he answered disgustedly,
referring to the card. I picked
it up. It was a printed communication,
in which somebody,
whose name I forget, requested
the pleasure of George's presence
at the marriage of his daughter
Something to Mr. Somebodyelse.</p>

<p>I read it aloud. "What's
wrong with that?" I asked.
"Were you in love with her
yourself?"</p>

<p>"I was not," said George
shortly. "To the best of my
knowledge I have never even set
eyes on the wretched girl, and
never want to. My implication
in the affair rests solely on my
having once been at school with
the bridegroom."</p>

<p>"Then what more touching
than that he should desire the
presence of his old comrade at
such a crisis?"</p>

<p>"<i>Presence!</i>" began George
bitterly. "If they'd said&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I stopped him. "I know the
pun," I said quickly, "and am
no longer capable of being
amused at it. So that is the
ground of your complaint. I
must say, George, that I regard
this as a little mean of you."</p>

<p>"You may," answered George.
"That shows you don't realise
the facts. If you were in my
position you wouldn't talk like
that. Why, look at it," he went
on, warming to his subject,
"here am I, a bachelor nearing
fifty, with an income, secure
certainly, but by no means lavish;
and what do we find? Scarcely a day
goes by without my receiving some
more or less veiled demand from
persons without a shadow of claim!</p>

<p>"Relatives," pursued George, "one,
of course, expects. I have myself five
elder sisters, all of them comfortably
married with my assistance. Pianos
or dinner-sets or whatever it happened
to be," explained George. "I make no
complaint there. Not even though
in these cases the initial outlay was
only the beginning. I am by now
seventeen times an uncle. A pleasant
position at first, but repetition stales
it. The expense of that alone is becoming
appalling. Why on earth didn't
<span class="sc">Henry VIII.</span> or somebody institute a
bounty for uncles?"</p>

<p>"It can't be so bad as all that."</p>

<p>"It would not be, if, as I say, the
matter was kept within one's own
family. But you see it isn't. I have
now reached that time of life in which
the rush of weddings appears to be
heaviest. Everybody I ever met seems
to be doing it, and using the fact as
an excuse for blackmail. I am a poor
man, and I have had enough of it!"</p>

<p>I made a sympathetic noise. As a
matter of fact, George's friends agree
that he is very comfortably off, but I
let that pass. "What are you going
to do about it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"This," answered George unexpectedly.
He opened his pocket-book
and produced a half-sheet of note-paper.
"This is going in <i>The Morning
Post</i> to-morrow. I wrote it some time
ago, but the hour has now come when
I must make a stand and endeavour to
get a little of my own back. So in she
goes!"</p>

<p>I took the paper and read as follows:
"1839-1914. Mr. George Pennywise,
of 1096, Upper Brook Street, having
remained a bachelor during twenty-five
years of eligibility, invites his numerous
friends to join with him in celebrating
his silver celibacy."</p>

<p>"The idea is not original," I said
coldly, "but I am interested to know
why you should select this particular
moment rather than any other. What
happened in '89?"</p>

<p>George looked faintly conscious.
"Nothing," he answered. "That's
just the point. It's what might have
happened. I think you've never heard
me speak of a girl called
Emeline? Anyhow, I was rather
struck at that time; we were
staying in the same house that
autumn, and I believe everybody
expected me to propose. Only,
somehow I didn't. But it was
the closest shave I've ever had,
and, as that was just twenty-five
years ago, I began counting from
then."</p>

<p>"Did Miss&mdash;er Emeline share
the general expectation?"</p>

<p>"To be candid, I rather fancy
she did. Several of her set
were quite nasty about it afterwards,
though it was obviously
no business of theirs. She
married somebody else later on,
and lives in Ireland." George
sighed reflectively.</p>

<p>As it was apparent that he
would shortly become sentimental,
a condition for which
he is unfitted, I took my leave.
"You're not really going to put
that nonsense in the paper?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"I am," said George, recovering
abruptly. "If there
is any way in which a put-upon
bachelor can get equal
with the world, I mean to take
it. I regard it as a public duty.
Look in again next week, and
you'll see the result."</p>

<p>Curiosity brought me on my
next visit to George with more
anticipation than usual. The
advertisement had duly appeared. But
my inquiries found him oddly reticent.</p>

<p>"Look here, George," I said at
length, "what did that paragraph
produce?"</p>

<p>"I got stacks of letters, mostly
humorous, that will require answering."</p>

<p>"No presents?"</p>

<p>"One," answered George reluctantly,
"from Emeline."</p>

<p>This was intriguing. George's manner
with regard to it was discouraging, not
to say morose. But I am not easily
put off.</p>

<p>"What sort of present?" I persisted.</p>

<p>"Oh, handsome enough. A silver
frame, quite good in its way, with a
family group of herself and her husband
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page367" id="page367"></a>[pg 367]</span>
and three kids inside it. I shall take
that out."</p>

<p>"Any inscription?"</p>

<p>The moment I had said it I saw
that I had found the trouble.</p>

<p>"Only three words," answered George
evasively. He hesitated. "But there,
Emeline never did know how to express
herself."</p>

<p>"George," I demanded sternly, "what
were those three words?"</p>

<p>"<i>A Thank Offering</i>," said George.</p>

<h2>GLEANINGS FROM GRUB STREET.</h2>

<h3>(<i>By our Special Parasite.</i>)</h3>

<p>A brilliant reception is being prepared
for Professor Hjalmar Stormbarner,
the Finnish novelist, on the
occasion of his first visit to England in
June. An address of welcome, composed
by Mr. <span class="sc">C. K. Shorter</span> and Sir
<span class="sc">Robertson Nicoll</span>, with lyrics by Mr.
<span class="sc">Max Pemberton</span> and Lord <span class="sc">Burnham</span>,
will be presented to him at the
Grafton Gallery, and Dr. <span class="sc">Clifford</span>
is arranging what he happily calls
a "pious orgy of congratulation"
at the Caxton Hall, at which Sir
<span class="sc">Alfred Mond</span>, Baron <span class="sc">de Forest</span>, and
Mr. <span class="sc">Thornton</span>, the new manager of the
Great Eastern Railway, will deliver
addresses. A demonstration in Hyde
Park in honour of our guest is also
being organised by his English publishers,
Messrs. Dodder and Dodder, at
which their principal authors will
speak at thirteen different platforms,
and a resolution will be simultaneously
moved by blast of trumpet that Professor
Stormbarner is the greatest
novelist in the world.</p>

<p>Professor Stormbarner is of course
best known in this country as the
author of the famous romances, <i>Letters
from Limbo</i>, <i>The Devil's Ducats</i>, <i>Narcotic
Nelly</i> and <i>The Sarcophagus</i>, but
his versatility and accomplishments in
other departments of mental activity
will come as a surprise to his English
admirers. He has penetrated the Arctic
circle in a bath-chair drawn by reindeer;
he plays with great skill on the
balalaika, and he has translated most
of the works of Mr. <span class="sc">Edmund Gosse</span>
into M&aelig;so-Gothic. At the present
moment he is undoubtedly the first
favourite for the <span class="sc">Nobel</span> Prize, though
<span class="sc">Willie Ferrero</span> runs him close in
virtue of the patronage of Mr. <span class="sc">Andrew
Carnegie</span> and the Dowager-Empress
of <span class="sc">Russia</span>.</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<p>Perhaps the finest and most convincing
tribute to the overwhelming
genius of the great Finnish romancer
is the quatrain recently written in his
honour by Mr. <span class="sc">Edmund Gosse</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Watts-Dunton</span> and Professor <span class="sc">Garner</span>&mdash;</p>
<p>Are all united in Stormbarner.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>We understand that during his visit

at the famous health resort which her
genius has done so much to adorn.
Her only regret is that she has had to
leave at home her Persian cat Abracadabra,

by the way, figures prominently in a

<h2>"WRONGLY ATTRIBUTED."</h2>

<p>You've heard of <span class="sc">Willy Ferrero</span>, the
Boy Conductor? A musical prodigy,
seven years old, who will order the
fifth oboe out of the Albert Hall as
soon as look at him. Well, he has a
rival.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Willy</span>, as perhaps you know, does
not play any instrument himself; he
only conducts. His rival (Johnny, as
I think of him) does not conduct as
yet; at least, not audibly. His line is
the actual manipulation of the pianoforte&mdash;the
Paderewski touch. Johnny
lives in the flat below, and I hear him
touching.</p>

<p>On certain mornings in the week&mdash;no
need to specify them&mdash;I enter my
library and give myself up to literary
composition. On the same mornings
little Johnny enters his music-room
(underneath) and gives himself up to
musical composition. Thus we are at
work together.</p>

<p>The worst of literary composition is
this: that when you have got hold of
what you feel is a really powerful idea
you find suddenly that you have been
forestalled by some earlier writer&mdash;<span class="sc">Sophocles</span>
or <span class="sc">Shakspeare</span> or <span class="sc">George
R. Sims</span>. Then you have to think again.
This frequently happens to me upstairs;
and downstairs poor Johnny will find
to his horror one day that his great
work has already been given to the
world by another&mdash;a certain Dr. <span class="sc">John
Bull</span>.</p>

<p>Johnny, in fact, is discovering "God
Save the King" with one finger.</p>

<p>As I dip my pen in the ink and
begin to write, Johnny strikes up. On
the first day when this happened, some
three months ago, I rose from my chair
and stood stiffly through the performance&mdash;an
affair of some minutes, owing
to a little difficulty with "Send him
victorious," a line which always bothers
Johnny. However, he got right through
it at last, after harking back no more
than twice, and I sat down to my
work again. Generally speaking, "God
Save the King" ends a show; it would
be disloyal to play any other tune after
that. Johnny quite saw this ... and
so began to play "God Save the King"
again.</p>

<p>I hope that <span class="sc">His Majesty</span>, the <span class="sc">Lord
Chamberlain</span>, the late Dr. <span class="sc">Bull</span>, or
whoever is most concerned, will sympathise
with me when I say that this
time I remained seated. I have my
living to earn.</p>

<p>From that day Johnny has interpreted
Dr. <span class="sc">John Bull's</span> favourite
composition nine times every morning.
As this has been going on for three
months, and as the line I mentioned
has two special rehearsals to itself
before coming out right, you can
easily work out how many send-him-victoriouses
Johnny and I have collaborated
in. About two thousand.</p>

<p>Very well. Now, you ask yourself,
why did I not send a polite note to
Johnny's father asking him to restrain
his little boy from over-composition,
begging him not to force the child's
musical genius too quickly, imploring
him (in short) to lock up the piano and
lose the key? What kept me from this
course? The answer is "Patriotism."
Those deep feelings for his country
which one man will express glibly by
rising nine times during the morning
at the sound of the National Anthem,
another will direct to more solid uses.
It was my duty, I felt, not to discourage
Johnny. He was showing qualities
which could not fail, when he grew up,
to be of value to the nation. Loyalty,
musical genius, determination, patience,
industry&mdash;never before have these qualities
been so finely united in a child of
six. Was I to say a single word to
disturb the delicate balance of such a
boy's mind? At six one is extraordinarily
susceptible to outside influence.
A word from his father to the effect
that the gentleman above was getting
sick of it, and Johnny's whole life
might be altered.</p>

<p>No, I would bear it grimly.</p>

<p>And then, yesterday, who should
write to me but Johnny's father himself.
This was the letter:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I do not wish to interfere
unduly in the affairs of the other
occupants of these flats, but I feel bound
to call your attention to the fact that
for many weeks now there has been a
flow of water from your bathroom
which has penetrated through the
ceiling of my bathroom, particularly
after you have been using the room in
the mornings. May I therefore beg
you to be more careful in future not to
splash or spill water on your floor,
seeing that it causes inconvenience to
the tenants beneath you?</p>

<p>Yours faithfully, <span class="sc">Jno. McAndrew.</span>"</p>

<p>You can understand how I felt about
this. For months I had been suffering
Johnny in silence; yet, at the first little
drop of water, from above, Johnny's
father must break out into violent
abuse of me. A fine reward! Well,
Johnny's future could look after itself
now; anyhow, he was doomed with a
selfish father like that.</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Dear Sir</span>," I answered defiantly,&mdash;"Now
that we are writing to each
other I wish to call your attention to
the fact that for many months past
there has been a constant flow of one-fingered
music from your little boy,
which penetrates through the floor of
my library and makes all work impossible.
May I beg you therefore to
see that your child is taught a new
tune immediately, seeing that the
National Anthem has lost its first
freshness for the tenants above him?"</p>

<p>His reply to this came to-day.</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have no child.</p>

<p>Yours faithfully, <span class="sc">Jno. McAndrew</span>."</p>

<p>I was so staggered that I could only
think of one adequate retort.</p>

<p><span class="sc">"Dear Sir</span>," I wrote,&mdash;"I never
have a bath."</p>

<p>So that's the end of Johnny, my boy
prodigy, for whom I have suffered so
long. It is not Johnny but Jno. who
struggles with the National Anthem.
He will give up music now, for he
knows I have the bulge on him; I can
flood his bathroom whenever I like.
Probably he will learn something quieter&mdash;like
painting. Anyway, Dr. <span class="sc">John
Bull's</span> masterpiece will rise no more
through the ceiling of the flat below.</p>

<p>On referring to my encyclop&aelig;dia, I
see that, according to some authorities,
"God Save the King" is "wrongly
attributed" to Dr. <span class="sc">Bull</span>. Well, I
wrongly attributed it to Johnny. It
is easy to make these mistakes.</p>

<h2>HOW TO IMPROVE LONDON.</h2>

<p>We were discussing London's needs.
Each of us was suggesting some long-felt
want which most appealed to him
or her.</p>

<p>Some had declared that what London
chiefly wanted was a tube from Victoria
to Chelsea. Someone else said that
what it chiefly wanted was a glass roof
over Bond Street and the chief shopping
area. Someone else said that what it
chiefly wanted was perforated pavements
to let the rain through at once&mdash;and
so on.</p>

<p>"What I want," said a pretty girl&mdash;so
pretty that I almost got up and set
about providing her with it&mdash;"is a
guide to the cinemas. I adore cinemas,
but there is no means of knowing what
is on unless you go to the place itself.
Then very likely it's some stupid long
play, with more printed descriptions
than deeds and more letters to read
than people to see. Now there ought
to be a list of all the cinema programmes
on sale at the bookstalls, like <i>The
Times</i> and <i>Spectator</i>."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you have a cinema critic
too," someone asked, "like Mr.
<span class="sc">Walkley</span>, to say how the films
amused him, and so on?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't want that," she said.
"But I should like information as to
how long they were, and if they were
American or Italian or French or
English, and I should like a star to be
put against those which Mr. <span class="sc">Redford</span>
had not thought splendid."</p>

<p>When it came to my turn I said that
London's most crying need was a
tailors' clearing-house.</p>

<p>"What on earth is that?" they
asked.</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "I'll tell you. All
men have tailors, and for the most part
they stick to them, because they find
them all right, or fear to go further afield
to begin all over again. But every now
and then it happens, no matter how
good the tailor, that a coat is stubborn.
It goes on being wrong. Fitting after
fitting leaves it even worse than before;
and the result is that one either loses
one's temper and bangs out of the place
and never enters it again, or, not wishing
to hurt the tailor's feelings, one accepts
defeat and gives the coat away the
next day at considerable personal loss.
In other words, a time comes when one
either cannot, through disgust, bring
oneself to visit one's tailor again on
that matter, or when one cannot,
through sympathy, bring oneself to ask
him to do any more. Don't you know
that?"</p>

<p>They agreed.</p>

<p>"Very well then. This is where the
clearing-house comes in. The tailor
there is prepared to tackle such cases
as those I have described. He will
come to the coat with an open mind
and put it right. You can ask him,
without any false delicacy, to do so
because it is his business. That's what
London most needs," I concluded.</p>

<p>"I daresay you're right," said
another of the party; "but in my
opinion what London most needs is a
good restaurant which has pork-pie on
its bill of fare."</p>

  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>A lady's eyes and a calf-topped boot,</p>

<p class="i8">A perfect cube.</p>

<p>"It is better than all those beastly Dutch</p>

<p class="i8">At his mop-crowned head.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>He went to the further side of the room</p>
<p class="i2">And flecked the canvas with daubs of mud;</p>

<p><i>Lloyd Charon (to Plutocratic Shades).</i> "Your fares will cost you more!"</p></div>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, May 4.</i>&mdash;Not
since epoch-making night four
years ago has House been so densely
crowded in anticipation of Budget
statement. Amongst most honourable
traditions of English public life is absolute
secrecy in which Budgets are
wrapped till veil is lifted by Chancellor
of Exchequer. Somehow it gets known
in advance when a particular one will
prove to be of exceptional public and
personal interest. Thus it was to-night.
Hence the crowd that filled
every bench on floor, every nook and
cranny of the galleries.</p>

<p>Expectation fully realised. <span class="sc">Lloyd
George</span>, Atlas in miniature, lightly
bore on his shoulders weight of biggest
Budget ever presented to House of Commons.
Total expenditure &pound;210,203,000.
Total revenue &pound;210,455,000. Balance
in hand, &pound;252,000.</p>

<p>How <i>Mr. Micawber's</i> heart would
have glowed over this realisation in
colossal figures of his cherished principle!
You remember his formula to
young <i>Copperfield</i>: "Annual income
twenty pounds, annual expenditure
nineteen six; result happiness.
Annual income twenty pounds,
annual expenditure twenty pounds
ought and six; result misery."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lloyd George</span>, keeping this axiom
steadily in view, after dallying with
income and expenditure counted by the
hundred million, came out triumphant
with &pound;252,000 in his pocket.</p>

<p>Spoke for two hours and forty
minutes. Avoiding flights of eloquence
that were wont to entrance <span class="sc">Gladstone's</span>
audience on Budget nights, resisting
temptation to epigram that beset Mr.
<span class="sc">Chancellor Lowe</span>, was content with
plain business statement. The massive
figures dealt with, the millions lightly
scattered there and sedulously picked
up here, left some passages obscure.
<span class="sc">Son Austen</span> well advised in reserving
criticism till he had opportunity of
studying statement set forth in print.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:40%;"><a href="images/373b.png"><img width="100%" src="images/373b.png" alt=""/></a><p><i>Mr. Chancellor Micawber.</i> "Annual income
twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen
nineteen six; result, happiness."</p></div>

<p>A passage in speech followed with
breathless interest below Gangway
dealt with increase of super-tax. <span class="sc">Chancellor</span>
set forth how what he called
a "&pound;3,500 man" would, in addition to
ordinary income-tax, pay 1.7<i>d.</i> in the &pound;.
Running up the gamut to "a &pound;10,000
man" he mentioned that the affluent
citizen would oblige with an additional
8.9<i>d.</i></p>

<p>"I can," he blandly added, "go
further if anybody specially wants me."</p>

<p>General expression of sympathy with
<span class="sc">Houston</span> when he asked what the
&pound;100,000 man would be called upon to
pay.</p>

<p>"The hon. gentleman," said the
<span class="sc">Chancellor</span>, with encouraging smile
bent on inquirer, "will be let off with
an additional 15.3<i>d.</i>"</p>

<p>The Member for the Toxteth division
of Liverpool didn't seem so pleased
with this prospect as might have been
expected.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Budget brought in.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Lord "Bob" Cecil</span>,
whose industry is equalled only by his
ingenuousness, posed the <span class="sc">Premier</span> with
awkward question. Wants to know
"whether the Government propose to
continue Sir <span class="sc">Nevil Macready's</span> appointment
as resident magistrate; if so,
whether he will be able in that capacity,
in case of civil disturbance, to call upon
himself as a military officer to give
assistance to the civil power?"</p>

<p>Suggests difficulty at first sight appalling.
On historic occasion <span class="sc">John
Bright</span> found himself in analogous
quandary. As he then protested in ear
of sympathising House: "I cannot
turn my back upon myself." True that
in the last three years of his political
career he achieved the apparently
impossible. But exception does not
make a rule.</p>

<p>More exact parallel found in case of
eldest of <i>Dr. Blimber's</i> pupils. <i>Mr.
Toots</i>, we know, occupied his time at
school chiefly in writing long letters to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page374" id="page374"></a>[pg 374]</span>
himself from persons of distinction
addressed "P. Toots, Esq., Brighton,
Sussex," which with great care he preserved
in his desk. Thus, in case of
emergency, Sir <span class="sc">Nevil Macready</span>, Resident
Magistrate, might write to General
Sir <span class="sc">Nevil Macready</span> in command of
troops in Ireland a note something to
this effect:</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;From information received,
I expect Ulster will be in a blaze before
the end of the week. Please hold
yourself in readiness to co-ordinate
the action of your troops with that of
the Royal Irish Constabulary.&mdash;Your
obedient Servant, <span class="sc">Nevil Macready</span>,
Resident Magistrate. To Sir <span class="sc">Nevil
Macready</span>, General in command of
troops in Ireland."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Premier</span> tried to explain away the
situation. Remembering recreation of
<i>Mr. Toots</i>, it is not really so bad as
<span class="sc">Lord "Bob's"</span> earnest desire for preservation
of law and order in Ulster leads
him to fear.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;On motion of <span class="sc">Prime
Minister</span> new Standing Order dealing
with blocking motions carried <i>nemine
contradicente</i>.</p>

<p><i>House of Lords, Thursday</i>,&mdash;The
death of the Duke of <span class="sc">Argyll</span> leaves
the House of Lords poorer by withdrawal
of a quiet, gracious presence. I
talked with him here a few days before
the Easter recess. To-night the <span class="sc">MacCailean
Mhor</span>, on his way to his last
resting-place in the Highlands, sleeps
amid the stately silence of Westminster
Abbey, unawakened by the noiseless
footsteps of the ghosts of great men
dead. Thus in Plantagenet times the
coffined body of the wife of <span class="sc">Edward I.</span>,
brought from Lincoln to Westminster,
halted by the way, Charing Cross being
the last of the nine resting-places of
her bier.</p>

<p>A happy marriage which brought him
into close kinship with the Sovereign
forbade the Duke's taking active part in
political life. It gave him fuller opportunity
for dallying with his dearly-loved
foster-mother, Literature. Endowed
with the highest honours birth could
give or the Sovereign bestow, he bore
them with a modesty that made others
momentarily forget their existence.
Circumstances precluding his living
at Inveraray Castle and keeping up
its feudal state, it was characteristic
of him that he cheerily homed himself
in a cottage some two miles
down the loch-side, originally built for
a factor. Little by little he enlarged
the residence till Dalchenna House
became a roomy mansion. Here, in
company of a few choice companions,
it was his delight to stay during the
autumn months. He kept to his study
in the morning, engaged in literary
work or dealing with his vast correspondence.
After luncheon he led his
guests forth, usually on foot, to tread
the Highland ways he knew since boyhood,
when as Marquis of <span class="sc">Lorne</span> he
presented the picture of manly beauty
in Highland dress that to-day adorns
the hall of Inveraray Castle.</p>

<p>In later years he built for himself a
ch&acirc;let set amid the pine-trees of the
ancient French forest of Hardelot,
within sight and sound and scent of
the sea. Like Dalchenna this began in
a small way. Enamoured with the
peace and rest that brooded over the
place, he went on year by year enlarging
and embellishing it.</p>

<p>According to long-laid plans he was
to have spent the Easter recess in his
French retreat. Almost at the last moment
duty called him elsewhere, and,
as was his wont, he uncomplainingly
obeyed. But he insisted that two old
friends, whom he had bidden to keep
Easter tryst with him, should not alter
their plans. So the ch&acirc;let, with its
dainty appointments and its domestic
establishment after the <span class="sc">Duke's</span> own
heart&mdash;a French peasant and his wife,
who acted as butler and cook&mdash;was
placed at their disposal, he bestowing
infinite pains upon arrangements for
their comfort whilst under his roof.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:40%;"><a href="images/374.png"><img width="100%" src="images/374.png" alt=""/></a><p>"It was hardly a tactful way of trying to
convert him to the movement to place a bomb
under his throne at St. Paul's."&mdash;<i>The Bishop
of <span class="sc">London</span> in the Debate on Lord <span class="sc">Selborne's</span>
Bill for Female Enfranchisement.</i></p></div>

<p>This little episode, the most recent
in a busy life, is a typical instance of
his unselfishness and untiring thought
for others.</p>

<p>A scholar of wide reading, a man of
shrewd judgment, and, as his government
of Canada disclosed, a statesman
of high degree, he might have filled a
part in public affairs at least as lofty as
that commanded by his distinguished
father. Debarred from such career he
was content to live up to the highest
standard of Christian conduct. If a
line of commentary might be added
to the inscription on the coffin which
to-morrow journeys northward to lie
beside those of the ten Dukes of <span class="sc">Argyll</span>
at rest in the burial-place of the Campbells
at Kilmun, here it is written in
one of the oldest of Books: "He went
about doing good."</p>

  </div>  </div>
</div>

<p>When there is a good deal of
talk on the stage about a certain
character, who however remains
"off" throughout the play and
gives you no chance to discover
for yourself what he is like, then
I have an instinctive distrust of
him. If his name is as bad as
<i>Cecil</i> he is practically doomed.
<i>Betty Dunbar</i>, widow, ran away
from her rich sister's house and
spent a night in London with
such a <i>Cecil</i>. <i>Betty</i> had arrived
at the dangerous age of forty,
and was temporarily and ridiculously
in love with this young
bounder (as I felt him to be) of
twenty-two. But the fact that,
at the very time when she was
thus making a fool of herself in
London, her younger son, <i>Jack</i>,
was falling off a tree and nearly
killing himself in the country
brought her to her senses. When
she returned to the country to
find <i>Jack</i> at death's door, her
love for <i>Cecil</i> died and she could
only think of him with hatred.</p>

<p>Now I can remember wondering,
when I read <i>The Vicar of
Wakefield</i> at an early and innocent
age, why <i>Dr. Primrose</i> was
so anxious that his daughter
<i>Olivia</i> should be married to the
beast with whom she had eloped,
when it would be so much better
for her if <i>Thornhill</i> left her (as
he was willing to do) and she
returned unmarried to her father.
I am older now, and I know
that in the good Vicar's opinion
only thus could his daughter's
"honour" be "preserved." But
the world is also older now, and
perhaps the oldest person in it
is the woman suffragist&mdash;such a
one, for instance, as <i>Betty's</i> elder
sister, <i>Ethel</i>, who carried copies
of <i>Votes for Women</i> about with
her when she strolled through
the home park. That <i>Ethel</i>
should share <i>Dr. Primrose's</i> ingenuous
views on this matter is
unbelievable&mdash;by me, but not by
the author. For she insisted,
under threat of cutting off supplies,
that <i>Betty</i> should marry
<i>Cecil</i>, and (so to speak) become
a lady again. <i>Betty</i> wisely refused,
which left the way clear
for <i>Sir Egbert Englefield</i>, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page376" id="page376"></a>[pg 376]</span>
so brought down the curtain. I
haven't mentioned <i>Sir Egbert</i> before,
but he was there or thereabouts all the
time, and being in the flesh Mr. <span class="sc">H. V.
Esmond</span>, author of the play, it was
obvious that he would have the pull
over any unseen <i>Cecil</i> in the final
arrangement of partners.</p>

<p>Although <i>Ethel</i> appears to be impossible,
and the other characters mostly
conventional, <i>The Dangerous Age</i> makes
a very charming entertainment at the
Vaudeville, a patchwork of humour and
pathos ingeniously woven together; of
which the humour was as fresh and
jolly as anything I have heard on the
stage, and the pathos put me in greater
danger of being caught "blubbering
like a seal" than I have ever been
before. It is to Masters <span class="sc">Reginald
Grasdorff</span> and <span class="sc">Roy Royston</span> that
I owe my special thanks. Two
more delightful boys on the stage
cannot be imagined. Indeed I
was at least as sorry as <i>Betty</i>
when <i>Jack</i> fell off his tree, for I
knew then that I should not see
Master <span class="sc">Roy</span> again that evening.
Fortunately <span class="sc">Reginald</span> remained,
and acted with great skill a part
which suddenly became serious.
But I wish Osborne boys on
the stage wouldn't wear their
uniforms in the holidays when
they climb trees. It emphasizes
their Osbirth (if I may use the
word) at the expense of their
boyishness. Miss <span class="sc">Eva Moore</span>
and Mr. <span class="sc">Esmond</span> were excellent,
the latter playing a perfect
<span class="sc">Wyndham</span> part without the
<span class="sc">Wyndham</span> mannerisms. Mr.
<span class="sc">Leslie Banks</span>, representing an
entirely incredible person, was exactly
like somebody I knew; a feat,
it seems to me, of some skill.</p>

<p><i>Lady Wynmarten</i>:            Miss <span class="sc">Marie Tempest.</span></p>

<p>When a young widow wants to
commit a flagrant outrage on the proprieties
in order to scandalise a detested
mother-in-law, and selects the first
likely man for her accomplice, she will
probably not be deterred by fear of any
damage that may occur to his reputation.
When <i>Lady Wynmarten</i> engaged
the services of <i>Bill Carrington</i> she
had the less compunction because he
was only over from India for a week
and might rely upon the fresh air
of the high seas to repair the damage
and displace the breath of scandal.
Unfortunately, his very limited time in
England had been carefully scheduled
for the execution of several important
contracts; and when his firm heard of
his escapade and found him twenty
minutes late for a business appointment,
he was briefly booted.</p>

<p>It was at this point that the critics
began to think of taking notes on their
cuffs about <span class="sc">Browning's</span> views on the
danger of "playing with souls," but
found on reflection that the case was
not so serious as that. For we knew
all the time (by the splendour of her
frocks) that the lady was rich, and we
had gathered half-way through that she
was prepared to accept <i>Bill</i> in marriage
and make an honest man of him.
Not that their joint adventure had
actually achieved immorality. She had
simply dined with him, done a play,
had supper at the Savoy, gone on to a
Covent Garden ball, failed to effect an
entrance into her house (having deliberately
mislaid her latch-key and cut
the bell-wire), and been taken a little
before milk-time to her mother-in-law's,
where her appearance had caused the
greatest confusion and scandal, which
was indeed the ultimate purpose of
the scheme. But the fatal devotion of
her French maid, who telephoned next
morning to all her mistress's friends to
say that her bed had not been slept in,
and that a dark mystery brooded over
her whereabouts, tended to promote a
garrulous interest in her conduct.</p>

<p>It was a sad pity that we were not
permitted to witness any phase of this
adventure. One seemed to be assisting at
a farce with the fun left out. I should
have greatly enjoyed being present at
the moment when her ladyship claimed
the hospitality of her mother-in-law's
roof. But perhaps this experience
would have left me in a frame of mind
too frivolous for the right reception of
the grave things that were to follow.</p>

<p>Yet the play was mixed of all moods,
from gay to earnest, and offered excellent
scope for the versatility of Miss
<span class="sc">Marie Tempest</span>. Mr. <span class="sc">Clarence's</span> humour,
on the other hand, was not so
well served; and there were frequent
<i>longueurs</i> during the episodes in which
the <i>Dowager Lady Wynmarten</i> figured.
She was meant to be a terror, and had
some very vicious things to say; but
Miss <span class="sc">Agnes Thomas</span> delivered them
with superfluously well-bred restraint,
and the level tone of her bitter suavity

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Graham Browne</span> showed a very
nice self-repression as the widow's
dummy. But he let himself go with
his cigarettes which in moments of

appalling recklessness after the first
two whiffs.</p>

<p>The rest of the cast did ample
justice to a play which, if it is Mr.

for its promise. But the
next time he writes a Four-Act

more than one Act without any

<h2>THE SULTAN OF MOROCCO.</h2>

<p>"It was here yesterday," I said. "I am quite sure I
saw it."</p>

<p>"Saw what?" said the lady of the house.</p>

<p>"A letter," I said, "that required an answer."</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "there are about fifty letters of that
kind on your table there. Why don't you answer some of
those? You can take your pick of them."</p>

<p>"Those are different," I said. "They've waited a long
time, and it won't hurt them to wait a little longer. The
one I want came yesterday, and required an immediate
answer. I remember it quite distinctly."</p>

<p>"Why not answer it, then, without finding it? I'll
dictate to you:&mdash;'Dear Sir or Madam,&mdash;In answer to your
obliging letter, I beg to say that I much regret I shall be
unable to attend the meeting of the blank committee on the
blank of blank, owing to a previous engagement to be
present at the meeting of the blank association for the
blank blank blank. I enclose herewith my subscription of
blank, and remain, with apologies for my delay, yours
blankly, etc., etc.' Fire away; you can't go wrong."</p>

<p>"I am not sure," I said, "that I like all those blanks.
It's a good model, of course, but it's just a bit too sketchy."</p>

<p>"If you remember the letter so perfectly you can fill in
the blanks as you go along."</p>

<p>"I didn't say I remembered it so perfectly as all that. I
remember getting it. I remember it was marked 'Urgent
and confidential' or 'Private and immediate,' or something
of that kind, and I remember putting it down on this
writing-table and making up my mind to answer it at once,
but I don't remember who it was from&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Whom</i> it was from."</p>

<p>"Amiable pedant! I don't remember who my importunate
correspondent was, or what address he or she wrote
from, or what it was about. It was one of those letters
that produce a general sense of discomfort, the sort you
want to forget but can't."</p>

<p>"Oh, but <i>you</i> can. I never heard of anything so completely
forgotten as this unfortunate letter."</p>

<p>"Really," I said, "you drive me to despair. Can't you
see that a man may remember the <i>existence</i> of a letter
without remembering all its petty details? For instance, I
know there's a Sultan of <span class="sc">Morocco</span>, but I don't know what
he's like, or what his name is, or how he's dressed, or what
his exact colour is. Still, there he is, you know."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. Morocco, I suppose, would find him."</p>

<p>"Then all you've got to do is to write him a respectful
letter, saying that you can't accept his Majesty's kind
invitation to the small and early dance at the Palace."</p>

<p>"I am not," I said, "in a humour for frivolity. I want
to write a letter."</p>

<p>"And I," she said proudly, "am doing my best to help
you."</p>

<p>"I put it down on this writing-table, and one of you has
moved it. Possibly it looked untidy, and one of you has
tidied it&mdash;you yourself, for choice. In that case I shall
never, never find it. To think that there is some one in the
world who is eagerly expecting a letter from me, who is
watching for the postman as he comes on his rounds, who
is constantly disappointed, who lapses finally into a sullen
acquiescence, who considers me unbusinesslike&mdash;and all
because you saw a letter which didn't please you, and so
you tidied it away. After all, it's my writing-table, and in
future I won't have anyone at it except myself."</p>

<p>"Don't be harsh," she said. "How do you know any
of us have been at what you call your table?"</p>

<p>"How do I know?" I said bitterly. "Look at these
neat little packets of papers all put carefully one on top
of the other. Look at my pens, look at my bills, look at
my cheque-book, look at my notepaper and envelopes&mdash;I
mean, don't look at them, because if you did you wouldn't
see them. They're tucked away out of sight, and all that
is left to me is a blotting pad, on which you have done
several interesting money addition sums, and Peggy has
drawn four Red Indians in crayons, and Helen has tentatively
written in ink the words 'alright' and 'allright.' Oh
yes, some of you have invaded my private domain and sat
at my table, and have first scattered and then re-asserted
my papers."</p>

<p>At this moment John entered the room, came and stood
beside me, and abstracted from the table a pencil and a
sheet of foolscap.</p>

<p>"There," I said, "you can see the result of your dreadful
example. Even this innocent child has learnt to pilfer
my writing materials."</p>

<p>"John," said his mother, "would you like to search your
father?"</p>

<p>"What's 'search'?" said John.</p>

<p>"Feel in his coat pockets and see if you can find a
letter."</p>

<p>John was quite willing. He inserted a pudgy hand into
one pocket after another, and finally extracted a rather
crumpled letter.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" I said. "He's got it."</p>

<p>"What is it?" she said.</p>

<p>"It is a courteous communication from Messrs. Wilfer and
Wontner, highly commending the virtues of their renowned
Hygeia tabloids, two to be taken daily after dinner."</p>

<p>"It's the most private and urgent letter I ever heard
of. And now, I suppose, you'll withdraw your most unjust
decree against our using the writing-table."</p>

<p>"Not at all," I said; "I make it stricter than ever. If
you hadn't used my table I should have looked in my coat
pocket and found the letter long ago."</p>

<p>"Anyhow," she said, "it's a comfort to think you won't
have to write to the Sultan of <span class="sc">Morocco</span>."</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<h3>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>}</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Beresford</span> is most warmly to be congratulated upon
his new book, <i>The House in Demetrius Road</i> (<span class="sc">Heinemann</span>).
Mr. <span class="sc">Beresford's</span> work has had from the first remarkable
qualities that place him beyond question amongst the first
half-dozen of the younger English novelists; but never
before, I think, have his talents had a subject so exactly
suited to their best display. It would be difficult to praise
too highly the grim and relentless effect of the author's
treatment of his subject. <i>Robin Gregg</i> is a drunkard, and
everyone about him&mdash;his secretary, his sister-in-law, his
little girl&mdash;is caught into the dingy cloud of his vice. The
house also is caught; and very fine indeed is the way in
which Mr. <span class="sc">Beresford</span> has presented his atmosphere&mdash;the
rooms, the dirty strip of garden, the shabby suburb, the
London rain&mdash;but beyond all these things is the central
figure of <i>Gregg</i> himself. Here is a character entirely new
to English fiction&mdash;a man who in spite of his degradation
has his brilliance, his humour and, above all, his mystery.
It is in this implication that, at the very heart of the man,
there are fine things too degraded and degraded things too
fine for any human record of them to be possible that the
exceptional merit of Mr. <span class="sc">Beresford's</span> work lies. In his
desire to avoid any possible cheapness or weak indulgence
he misses, perhaps, some effects of colour and pathos that
might, a little, have heightened the contrasts of his study;
and I do not feel that the woman is as vivid as she should
be. These things, however, affect very slightly a story that
its author may indeed be proud to have written.</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<p><i>Penelope</i> was the heroine. She was in what are called
reduced circumstances, and was moreover encumbered by
sisters who were not quite all that could have been wished
in the way of niceness. One day <i>Penelope</i>, looking through
an iron gate, saw a beautiful garden, full of flowers; and
the master of the garden, himself unseen, saw <i>Penelope</i>, and
loved her. So she accepted the invitation of his voice and
went into the garden and found that the master was a
young man so disfigured by a recent accident that he
had to wear blue spectacles and a shade. However, he
loved her and she didn't mind him, so that after a time
they became engaged, which was pleasant enough for
<i>Penelope</i>, who had henceforth the run of the garden and
leave to take home roses and things to the not-nice sisters.
Do you want to be told how presently these began to tempt
<i>Penelope</i>, urging her to insist that her lover should unmask,
and what happened when she yielded? Or have you seen
already that the story here called <i>A Garden of the Gods</i>
(<span class="sc">Alston Rivers</span>) is just a modern version of one that we
all used to be told in the nursery? Moreover, Beauty and
the Beast had been used once at least in this fashion
before Miss <span class="sc">Edith M. Keate</span> happened on the idea. But
that does not make the present any the less an amiable,
quietly entertaining story, if a little obvious. The characters
have never anything but a very distant resemblance to life;
and their speech is for the most part that of a lady novelist's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page380" id="page380"></a>[pg 380]</span>
creations rather than of human beings. But those who
demand "a good tale," with beauty properly distressed till
the last page, and there beatified with the knowledge that
"the darkness that surrounded her was scattered for ever,"
will find some highly agreeable pasturage in <i>A Garden of
the Gods</i>.</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<p><i>The Modern Chesterfield</i> (<span class="sc">Hurst and Blackett</span>) is a
book that I enjoyed only after overcoming a considerable
and partially-justified prejudice. In the first place, I
generally dislike stories told in epistolary form; in the
second, I almost always detest books that their publishers
advertise by selected "smart sayings." But I must honestly
admit that <i>The Modern Chesterfield</i> conquered me&mdash;chiefly,
I think, by its good-nature. The writer of these very
up-to-date paternal admonitions is supposed to be one
<i>Sir Benjamin Budgen, Bart</i>, "of Budgen House, Fleet
Street, E.C. and Cedar Court, Twickenham, Middlesex."
The addresses tell you what to expect&mdash;a satire on the
methods of popular journalism. This in fact is what you
get, but the satire is
so neat (and withal so
genial) and Mr. <span class="sc">Max
Rittenberg</span> has so
happy a knack of conveying
character in a
few lines that you are
simply bound to enjoy
reading him. One other
facility he has that
deserves the highest
praise: he tells his
story, in letters that
emanate from one side
only, without wearisome
repetition. There
is, I mean, hardly any
of that "You say in
your last that&mdash;and
ask me whether&mdash;etc.,"
which in similar volumes
always bores me
to ill-temper by its unlikeness
to the letter-writing
customs of real life. An explanatory line or two
at the head of each epistle puts you in possession of the
facts&mdash;that <i>Norman</i>, the son to whom they are written, has
left Cambridge, is proving unsatisfactory, has married an
Earl's daughter, and so on. That known, the letters tell
their own tale. They reveal the writer too (I refer to
<i>Sir Benjamin</i>): shrewd, clear-headed, vulgar and of bull-dog
courage. The disasters that overwhelm him in the
end do not leave his readers unmoved; bankrupt and
beaten he goes down fighting with the final characteristic
wire, in response to a suggestion of compromise by his
chief enemy, "Surrender be damned." A little book to
enjoy.</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<p>The village priest of Clogher, as depicted in two colours
on the paper wrapper of <i>Father O'Flynn</i> (<span class="sc">Hutchinson</span>), is
a man of plethoric habit and sanguine countenance engaged
in brandishing a large horsewhip. The book is dedicated
by Mr. <span class="sc">H. de Vere Stacpoole</span>, to Sir <span class="sc">E. Carson</span> and
Mr. <span class="sc">Redmond</span>, and in a short preface he says: "The Irish
Roman Catholic priest is the main factor in present-day
Irish affairs. I have attempted to catch him at his best in
the butterfly net of this trivial story...." I am anxious
not to do Mr. <span class="sc">Stacpoole</span> an injustice, but I do feel that
(as an entomologist) he gets easily tired. In the 250 pages
of <i>Father O'Flynn</i> there is a good deal of very tolerable
Irish "atmosphere"; a very tepid love affair between <i>Miss
Eileen Pope</i> and a gentleman from England "over for the
hunting;" a lot about old <i>Mr. Pope</i>&mdash;a moody maniac who
owned an illicit still at Clon Beg House, incurred the enmity
of the United Patriots, was in the habit of keeping followers
away from his beautiful step-daughter with a duck-gun,
and finally (after locking up his brother who came to
recover a debt) set fire to his own mansion&mdash;but practically
nothing at all about the reverend gentleman outside.
Beyond a few conversations with the "boys" and some
rescue work at the end, <i>Father O'Flynn</i> scarcely comes
into the plot. There is humour in the book and some
good description in patches, but towards understanding the
Irish priest it will probably assist Sir <span class="sc">Edward Carson</span> and
Mr. <span class="sc">John Redmond</span> very little more than it will assist a
settlement of the problems of Ulster. However, it may
give them an agreeable hour or so in a railway train, and
the announcement (also made on the cover) that it is "an
entirely new novel, now published for the first time," may
call their attention to
the value, in art as
well as politics, of emphatic
tautology.</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<p>I could wish that <i>The
Escape of Mr. Trimm,
His Plight and Other
Plights</i> (<span class="sc">Hodder and
Stoughton</span>) had been
one continuous whole,
instead of a number
of separate items, for
though Mr. <span class="sc">Irvin S.
Cobb</span> tells a tale well
he has not such a genius
for the short story that
he needs must express
himself through that
medium. Moreover, the
people of his imagination
are too interesting
to be readily parted
with; I should, for instance,
have liked to see how that gentleman convict,
<i>Mr. Trimm</i>, fared when, after his odd vicissitudes, he was
restored to the clutches of the Law and was set on to
do his time with the worst of them. There was plenty
of criminal company available, for Mr. <span class="sc">Cobb</span> makes some
speciality of perpetrators of dark deeds, and I feel that all the
characters and events of the subsequent stories could, with
a little ingenuity, have been worked into the one plot with
our fraudulent financier as the centrepiece. That wrong-headed
but chivalrous relic of the Southern Confederacy,
<i>Major Putnam Stone</i>, would fit in as the virtuous or comic
relief, his inborn lust for battle and his chance employment
as a newspaper reporter being just the things to combat
these felonious activities. There is certainly a lack of
lovable women in the book, yet I have always been led to
suppose that the U.S.A., the <i>locus in quo</i>, overflows with
feminine charm, and our author is obviously man enough to
appreciate and reproduce it for us. However, even a critic
must take things as they are, and it is a collection of short
stories that I have to complain about. My complaint, then,
reduces itself to this, that in the case of each of them I
regret their shortness.</p>
